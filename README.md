# AFC Richmond Analytics

This project aims to predict targeted player metrics in soccer,
with consideration to historical player performance, team play style, and league.
To this end, the documents in this folder include Python code to scrape raw player data,
clean data, and machine learning algorithms to model relationships and make predictions.

Interactive visualizations were created in Tableau and can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dan.hislop/viz/2021-22PlayerPredictionsforEuropesBig5FootballLeagues/PlayerViewer).
