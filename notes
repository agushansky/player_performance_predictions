Viz questions for team:
    * Should we use full measure name or abbreviation (e.g. TklW versus Tackles Won)
    * Do we want to show our league-by-league observations? (e.g. Bundesliga creates the most goals)
    * Finding the balance between too much info (busy viz) versus simplified. One approach: Attack vs. Defense

To do:

add league / position filter
add legend of stats
Add actual goals not just ranking


Enhance past-future stats: currently a single line: 
    * show more stats. is 10 too much?
    * enhance tool tip, include team name /league name for that year

Simplify skill finder further: currently splits defense vs offense:
    * can we do all on a single chart?
    * add League/team filter

Should we do a separate filter tab?  getting complex.
